              The best (and quickest) way to get help on a challenge is in our
              Discord server. There are thousands of other developers in there,
              so it's a great place to ask questions. We even have a dedicated
              "help" channel! If you haven't joined yet, you can get an invite
              to our Discord server here.

              We'd recommend reading our complete guide to submitting solutions
              . If you get stuck and need help, please feel free to ask
              questions in our Discord server, and we'll help you submit your
              project.

              We don't provide "official" solutions for the challenges. This is
              because there is no single perfect way to complete a challenge.
              Instead, you're encouraged to review other people's code in the
              community. You can learn so much by seeing how other people have
              approached the same challenges and giving them feedback.

              Frontend Mentor is a collaborative learning community where
              everyone can give feedback to each other. If you'd like to receive
              feedback from the community, please be sure to post a question
              when you submit your solution. The more specific you can be, the
              better. Being clear with your questions means you're much more
              likely to receive valuable feedback from others.

              Yes! Our challenges provide professional designs but there are no
              rules on what tools to use. So feel free to use anything you like
              to build your projects.
